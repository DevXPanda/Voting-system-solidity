Voting System 🗳️
This is a decentralized voting system built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. It allows for the addition of candidates, casting votes, and viewing results in a secure and transparent manner.

Features ✨
Add candidates (only by the contract owner)
Cast a vote for a candidate (only once per voter)
Retrieve the total number of votes for each candidate
Transparent and secure voting process
Prerequisites ✅
Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js and npm
Hardhat (for the development environment)
A local Ethereum network or Hardhat Network for deployment
Metamask (for interacting with the contract)
Installation 📦
Follow these steps to set up the project:

Clone the repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/DevXPanda/voting-system.git  
cd voting-system  
Install dependencies

bash
Copy code
npm install  
Compile the smart contract

bash
Copy code
npx hardhat compile  
Start a local Ethereum node (Hardhat Network)

bash
Copy code
npx hardhat node  
Deploy the contract to the local network

bash
Copy code
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost  
Usage 🚀
Interacting with the Contract:
Once deployed, copy the contract address from the deployment logs.

Use Hardhat console to interact with the contract:
bash
Copy code
npx hardhat console --network localhost  
Testing 🧪
Write your test cases in the test folder. To run the tests:

bash
Copy code
npx hardhat test

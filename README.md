Voting System 🗳️
This is a decentralized voting system built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. It allows for the addition of candidates, casting votes, and viewing results in a secure and transparent manner.

Features ✨
Add candidates (only by the contract owner).
Cast a vote for a candidate (only once per voter).
Retrieve the total number of votes for each candidate.
Transparent and secure voting process.
Prerequisites ✅
Before running this project, make sure you have:

Node.js and npm installed.
Hardhat installed as the development environment.
A local Ethereum network or Hardhat network for deployment.
Metamask installed for interacting with the contract.
Installation 📦
Follow these steps to set up the project:

Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/DevXPanda/voting-system.git
cd voting-system
Install dependencies:

bash:
npm install
Compile the smart contract:

npx hardhat compile
Start a local Ethereum node (Hardhat Network):

bash
npx hardhat node
Deploy the contract to the local network:

bash:
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
Usage 🚀
Interacting with the Contract:
Once deployed, copy the contract address from the deployment logs.

Use Hardhat console to interact with the contract:

bash:
npx hardhat console --network localhost

Testing:
Write test cases in the test folder.

Run tests:

bash
npx hardhat test
